# Emotion-Detection-with-GUI-for-face-voice-and-text
This project aims to develop an AI powered emotion detection system that analyzes emotion from facial expressions, voice tone and text input. Using computer vision, speech processing and natural langagues processing (NLP), the system classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness and anger.

### **Installation Instructions:**
1. **Ensure Python 3.10 is installed** (since TensorFlow 2.10 is required for GPU support on Windows).  
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv tf_env
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - **Windows:**  
     ```bash
     tf_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux:**  
     ```bash
     source emotion_env/bin/activate
     ```
4. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
